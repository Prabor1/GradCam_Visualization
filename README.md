# GradCam Visualization

Here I performed a mahine learning visualization named as gradcam. The dataset is on a classification problem, which consists of 6 classes. The classes are    
+ building
+ forest
+ glacier
+ mountain
+ sea
+ street


First of all a model is created using CNN. Then using GradCam trying to analysis why modelpredicted that, which section of our model leads the prediction, what is  the contribution of all portion of the image.    
The dataset and source code in python is given. Data is divided for training and testing. Some theory is also added, related to CNN and GradCam.
